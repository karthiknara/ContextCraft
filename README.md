# ContextCraft

ContextCraft is an open-source Python toolkit under development, designed to streamline the process of converting multi-modal relational datasets into prompt-completion pairs for fine-tuning language models.

## Status

This project is currently in the planning and early development phase. More information and features will be added as development progresses.

## Why 'ContextCraft'?

The name 'ContextCraft' was chosen to reflect the tool's capability to craft contextual data that is tailored for the fine-tuning of language models. Just as a craftsperson meticulously shapes materials into a final product, ContextCraft shapes raw data into structured prompt-completion pairs. These pairs are essential for language models to understand and generate human-like text, making ContextCraft a pivotal tool in the context of AI and machine learning.

## Using ContextCraft for Fine-tuning LMs

ContextCraft is particularly suited for preparing datasets to fine-tune pre-trained language models. The tool provides the ability to craft prompts that align with your specific domain, enabling more effective fine-tuning and thereby enhancing the model's performance on specialized tasks.

## Planned Features

- Data Input and Validation
